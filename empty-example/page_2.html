      <h1>Virtual Reality Plus Artificial Intelligence Can Be  Risk
        </h1>
      
       <p>Take the hypothetical case of a trader who participates in a transaction involving a major consumer products company. Current systems might flag this trade as an anomaly since this trader usually limits his activity to the energy sector. But that just begins the process for a compliance officer who then must search other records to determine the size and scope of the potential problem.
        </p>
      
      <p>With extended reality, the picture is completely different. Extended reality tools immediately identify the trader, their desk, all their trades undertaken in recent years, everyone with whom they have been in contact, their social media posts and spots any suspicious patterns or connections. These are then displayed in a graphic format that makes any anomalies immediately visible. The decision to investigate further – or to pursue other, more problematic cases – becomes easier.
        </p>
 
      <p>Imagine too that the trader was sitting in London, and that the consumer products company he traded was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The compliance officers from both regions involved could join up, in the extended reality environment to jointly assess and investigate the data behind the trader and his/her trades. With extended reality, both of these participants are brought together into the same ecosystem and have a holistic picture of the data, allowing for a closer level of interaction between compliance department professionals.
        </p>
     
      <p>For the most part, these scenarios today exist only on paper. But the extended reality future that lets organizations organize, analyze, visualize and present data in heretofore undreamed-of ways is not far off – and we see a number of organizations prototyping these enhanced approaches. Most financial services firms have already taken the first step towards adopting extended reality by aggregating vast quantities of data from internal and external sources. The next step is to put these tools together in an integrated manner. Extended reality will be an important element of training, sales and marketing campaigns, but it will also play a key role as firms re-think their strategies for dealing with a host of new and emerging risks.
